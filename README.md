- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **OpenAI API Key** for AI features (optional but recommended)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hireme.git
cd hireme
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

For AI features, you'll need API keys. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your API keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Required for AI mock interviews and resume parsing
- `HF_API_KEY` - Optional for additional AI features

**Note**: The application will run without these keys, but AI features will be disabled.

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
# Start all services (MongoDB, Backend, Frontend)
docker compose up -d

<<<<<<< HEAD
# View logs (optional)
docker compose logs -f

# Check service status
docker compose ps
```
=======
This command will:
- Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend
- Start the MongoDB database
- Connect all services via a Docker network
- Map the necessary ports to your host machine

### 5. Stop the Application
```bash
docker compose down
```

## üîß Development

### Local Development (Alternative to Docker)
If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker:

1. **Prerequisites**: Node.js 18+, MongoDB, npm/yarn
2. **Backend**: `cd backend && npm install && npm run dev`
3. **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev`
4. **Database**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas

### Docker Commands
```bash
# View service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f [service_name]

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up --build

# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down

# Remove all data (including database)
docker compose down -v
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are configured for production:
- `MONGODB_URI` - Production MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Strong JWT signing secret
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for AI features
- `NODE_ENV=production`

### Build for Production
```bash
# Build frontend
cd frontend && npm run build

# Install production dependencies
cd backend && npm install --production
```
